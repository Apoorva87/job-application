To improve your chances of getting hired, I recommend developing these skills through training or courses.\n\n**Current Absence from Resume**: The two relevant skills that would be beneficial for the job but are currently absent from your resume are:\n\n1. **Relationship-building**: This skill is essential for a Teller role in Consumer and Small Business Banking.\n2. **Risk Identification and Mitigation**: Developing this skill will help you identify potential fraud or risky accounts and take appropriate action to prevent loss.\n\n**Match Score**: Based on the alignment, I calculated a match score out of 100:\n\n`match_score_is_75`\n\nThis score reflects the moderate relevance between your resume and the job description. While you meet some of the minimum requirements, there is room for improvement in terms of developing skills specifically mentioned in the job posting.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting hired, I recommend highlighting your relevant experiences and skills, as well as acquiring the two skills mentioned above (relationship-building and risk identification/maintenance).",

This significant educational mismatch makes it unlikely that your skills and experience would be relevant to this position.\n* Although the job is located in Glasgow, Montana, your current location is Dallas, Texas, making it impractical for you to apply.\n\nHowever, considering the job requirements, I identified two relevant skills that could be beneficial for the Teller role, but are currently absent from your resume:\n\n1. Cash handling: As a Teller, you would be responsible for handling cash, processing transactions, and providing excellent customer service. Your current experience in software development and business operations may not directly translate to this skillset.\n2. Customer service: The job requires strong communication and interpersonal skills, which are essential for building relationships with customers. While your resume highlights your ability to work with cross-functional teams and stakeholders, it does not explicitly mention customer-facing experiences.\n\nMatch Score is 20\n\nThis low score indicates that the job description has little to no relevance to your current or past professional experiences, educational background, location, or skills.
